The script installs after the standard setup of NEON, selected application to it and configures the system for an optimal operability. Individual modules can be easily commented out by you. Use the "#" character for this. Have Fun!

INSTALLATION
------------

Run the following commands with SUDO or in a rootshell.

~~~
wget https://git.osit.cc/public-projects/kde-neon-installer/raw/master/kde-neon-22.04-installer.sh
chmod +x kde-neon-22.04-installer.sh
./kde-neon-22.04-installer.sh
~~~

If your country is blocked, you can download the script directly from Github: 

~~~
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boospy/KDE-Neon-Installer/master/kde-neon-22.04-installer.sh
chmod +x kde-neon-22.04-installer.sh
./kde-neon-22.04-installer.sh
~~~

You will find the following things in the script:

  * Systemupdate
  * Adding different repositories
  * Installing and uninstalling packages
  * System optimizations
  
  The script is divided into sections. You can freely decide what you want to install and what not. To do this, simply remove or add the "#" to the desired lines.
